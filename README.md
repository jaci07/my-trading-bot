🚀 Advanced Triple-Engine AI Trader (MT5)
This repository houses a high-performance algorithmic trading engine designed for MetaTrader 5. It seamlessly integrates institutional volume structure analysis with a three-layered Machine Learning approach (Random Forest) to evaluate trade probabilities in real-time.
🧠 Core Features
• Triple-Timeframe AI Consensus
The engine utilizes a hierarchical decision logic across three distinct timeframes:
• M15 (Macro): Establishes the institutional trend and structural market bias.
• M5 (Execution): Identifies specific volume setups such as VAH/VAL breakouts and rejections.
• M1 (Precision): Acts as a high-speed volatility filter to pinpoint exact entry timing.
• Volume Profile Engine
Validates price movements by analyzing actual volume distribution:
• Calculation of the Value Area (VAH/VAL) and the Point of Control (POC).
• Identification of Low Volume Areas (LVAs) for strategic "protected" Stop-Loss placement.
• Shadow Trading Memory
The engine continuously spawns virtual trade variants in the background. These "Shadow Trades" analyze various SL/TP scenarios and optimize the AI models without risking live capital.
• Smart Trade Management
• Automated Break-Even: Protects capital by moving the SL once partial profit targets are met.
• ATR-Based Trailing SL: Dynamic risk management that adjusts to current market volatility.
• Night Guard: Automatically secures or closes positions before high-spread rollover hours.
• Remote Control
Fully integrated with a Discord Bot for real-time monitoring, status reports, and remote account switching.
🛠️ AI Training Protocol (CRITICAL)
The AI models are broker-specific. You must train them yourself to account for the unique spreads and liquidity profiles of your specific trading account.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Configuration:
• Select your desired symbols in settings.py.
• Ensure MetaTrader 5 has fully downloaded the history for M1, M5, and M15 for all selected assets.
2. Launch Training:
• Run trainer.py.
• The process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the number of assets and your hardware.
3. Resuming Progress:
• If you need to stop the training, remove the already completed symbols from the list in settings.py and restart the script later.
• Completed models are saved automatically in the ai_models/ folder as .pkl files.
4. Ready for Deployment:
• Once the models are generated, main.py will automatically recognize, load, and use them for live market scanning.
